      "question": "Does the respondent need to install anything?",
      "answer": "No. Voice Capture works directly in the browser. The only requirement is that the respondent grants microphone permission when the browser asks — it's a standard permission, just like Google Meet or Zoom."

    "q2": {
      "question": "Am I charged for abandoned or failed responses?",
      "answer": "No. Only successfully completed responses count. If the respondent abandons before submitting, or if the transcription fails due to a technical error, it does not count against your monthly quota."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What if the respondent doesn't want to speak?",
      "answer": "The widget includes a text mode as an alternative. The respondent can type their response if they prefer not to use the microphone. Both modes count as one response."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Does it work on mobile?",
      "answer": "Yes. Voice Capture works on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge — both desktop and mobile. The experience is optimized for touch screens."

    "q5": {
      "question": "Can I integrate it with my survey platform?",
      "answer": "Yes. Voice Capture integrates with Alchemer, Qualtrics, and any web form that accepts custom HTML. Just paste a code snippet — no development required."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Where is the data stored?",
      "answer": "Audio and transcriptions are stored on secure infrastructure with encryption at rest and in transit. You can configure domain locking so the widget only works on your authorized sites."
